# Describing your data set and what data it contains:

# 2 questions relevant to our data set and why they are interesting and important:
1. Which licensees rely most heavily on promotional deductions relevant to the revenue?

Importance: Promotional deductions (bonuses, free spins, etc.) significantly impact the revenue generated from players, it allows licensees to see how heavily their profitability relies on these deductions, and they could then use to this to adjust/optimize their promotional strategies

Relation to data set: We pulled the “Licensee,” “Promotional Deductions,” and “Total Gross Gaming Revenue” columns to compare the promotional deductions to the total gross gaming revenue

2. How do each licensee’s total wagers compare to Patron Winnings across different years?
  Importance:
              Each licensee can see during what time of year they are spending the most money on online gambling
              They can use this information to adjust their budget for gambling expenses
  Relation to data set
              We used the “Licensee”, “Month Ending”, “Wagers”, and “Patron Winnings” columns to compare different licensees’ wagers across multiple time periods
