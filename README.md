# Describing your data set and what data it contains:

# 2 questions relevant to our data set and why they are interesting and important
1. Which licensees rely most heavily on promotional deductions relevant to the revenue?
Importance - Promotional deductions, such as bonuses, free spins, etc. significantly impact the revenue generated from players. This question allows licensees to see exactly how heavily their profitability relies on these deductions, which they could then use to adjust/optimize their promotional strategies. 
Relation to data set - From this data set, we are pulling the “Licensee,” “Promotional Deductions,” and “Total Gross Gaming Revenue” columns to compare the promotional deductions to the total gross gaming revenue.
2. How do each licensee’s total wagers compare to itself across different years?
Importance - Answering this question enables each licensee to see during what time of year they are spending the most money on online gambling. They can then use this information to adjust their budget for gambling expenses.
Relation to data set - In answering this question, we are using the “Licensee”, “Month Ending”, and “Wagers” columns to compare different licensees’ wagers across multiple time periods.
